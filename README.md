# GroupFour-Bookstore
Hi there! This is my project for Group Four Building Surveyors, ASP.NET MVC (C#).

### Functionality
I implemented CRUD operations for the books. The `Search` tab allows users to search books by title. The `Books` tab lists the three(3) books provided in the task sheet.

### Misses
* I wasn't able to implement the Reserve action since it required the Book Object to be passed to the next page and I didn't know how to do so.
* I wasn't able to implement authorization roles and login/registration due to my lack of practice, hence the CRUD operations are public, which does not meet the requirements.

### Side Note
I really wanted to challenge myself and learn how to write better ASP.NET, but my knowledge was limited and I wasn't able to complete the tasks to a satisfactory degree. Nonetheless, it was a good learning experience and I'm proud to share my thoughts on my progress.
